# **Easy Squad Mortar**

Easy Squad Mortar uses computer vision to calculate the landing location in real-time. This project leverages OpenCV and EasyOCR for computer vision tasks, the Qt framework for the graphical user interface, and Folium (a Python wrapper for the JavaScript Leaflet library) for map visualization.

## **Features**

- **Real-time Calculation**: Instantly computes mortar landing locations using advanced computer vision.
- **Dynamic Map Updates**: Displays accurate positions on a responsive map interface.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface built with the Qt framework.

- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage ensures smooth operation on most systems.
